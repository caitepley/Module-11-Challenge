# Module-11-Challenge

The purpose of this assignment is to scrape html from webpages, convert the data into a more useable format, and use the scraped data to perform an analysis. In part 1, text data is scraped from the webpage and is then stored in a Python dictionary. In part 2, a table of data is scraped from the webpage and then is converted into a pandas dataframe. The dataframe is then used to produce tables and plots to analyze the weather on the planet Mars.

## To Run:

Python needs to be installed in order to run the programs.

The Jupyter notebooks (part_1_mars_news.ipynb and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb) can be ran cell-by-cell or as a whole to scrape the webpages and produce the results and/or tables.
